# Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

# Example:

# Input:  [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
# Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

# Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

# Follow up:
# Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)


class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        output = []
        n = len(nums)
        p = 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            output.append(p)
            p = p * nums[i]
        
        p = 1
        
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            output[i] = output[i] * p
            p = p * nums[i]
        
        return output
